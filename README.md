Hello folks,

Etch-A-Sketch is a drawing board where we can draw anything.
I developed this using turtle graphics in python programming language.

Keys:
"w" = move forward
"s" = move backward
"a" = move counter-clockwise
"d" = move clockwise
"c" = clear screen

Enjoy the board,
And suggestions are welcome.
